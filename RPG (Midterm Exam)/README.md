# Town Level Design RPG (Midterm Exam)

## Overview
This project explores how to create an NPC with pathfinding and state-based behavior that changes depending on its interactions with the player. 
The goal is to add excitement and immersion by automating the NPCâ€™s actions dynamically.

## Guide
To activate the NPC, the player must enter its patrol zone. 
When the NPC gets close enough, it will detect the player as a chaseable target.
This triggers intense background music and sound effects to heighten the thrill of the chase.
