# 2D Platformer: Side Scrolling (Prelim Activity 3)

## Overview
This feature update adds 2D side-scrolling camera functionality that follows the player wherever they move.
It enhances the game's sense of journey and storytelling, helping players progress and discover areas previously unseen by the camera.

## Guide
To move with the camera, the player can use the 'A/D' or the 'Left/Right' arrow keys to walk sideways, and a 'Spacebar' to jump.
The camera automatically follows the character as these keys are pressed.
