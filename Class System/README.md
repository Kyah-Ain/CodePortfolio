# Class System for RPG (Prelim Activity 3)

## Overview
This project explores how to design a class system for an RPG, focusing on decision-making and character development. 
It dives into the hierarchical structure behind building characters and how each class choice shapes their role and abilities.

## Guide
Choose between two choices button after starting the hierarchy by clicking on the lowest hierarchy in the chain (which is the Adventurer). 
Then there's a reset button just in case you want to start over again.
